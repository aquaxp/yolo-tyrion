Yolo-Tyrion
===========

Yolo-Tyrion is Emcee (http://ilyabirman.net/projects/emcee/) free clone

So it shows what’s playing in iTunes:

Other apps distract with semi-transparent widgets over what you do. Yet, when you wonder what’s playing, there is no ansnwer on the screen.

Emcee is always visible. The song name does not scroll, it stands still.
And of course, you able to launch iTunes from menu.

In action:
